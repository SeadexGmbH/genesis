==== Steps and blocks

The genesis library generates code by using internally defined elements. 

Basic elements are called steps. There are: 

* <<Text step>> - containing a text sequence from the template file 
* <<Variable step>> - a variable that will be replaced by its value 

The 'blocks' are complex elements that can contain other elements (steps and other blocks): 

* <<Condition block>> - represents an 'if' 
* <<Loop block>> - represents a loop (more precisely: a 'for') 
* <<Switch block>> - represents a 'switch' statement. 
* <<Template block>> - represents a recipe block created from a template file
