==== Escape sequences

In genesis the '*$*' symbol represents the start of a command. For example: 

[source]
----
$var(variable_name)
$loop(condition_name)
$pool
----

genesis defines certain escape sequences. An escape sequence starts with a '*$*' (dollar sign) just like a command. 

===== Line break
genesis has a special command for inserting a new line: '*$@*'. When this sequence is found in the template, it will be replaced by a new line character. 

===== Print $

If a '$' is needed in the output, then a double '$' has to be used.


===== Example
[source]
----
I got $$s!
----

The template above will print 'I got $s!'
