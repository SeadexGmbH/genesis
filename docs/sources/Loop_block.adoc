==== Loop block

A loop block represents a 'for' loop. For each iteration of the loop, all nested elements will be created. 

===== Command
[source]
----
$loop(loop_name)
// child steps
$pool
----

A loop block must end with a '*$pool*' command. If the loop is not correctly ended (with '*$pool*'), then the template is considered to be ill-formed. 

NOTE: New line after the close command '$pool' is discarded.
