==== Condition block

A condition block represents an 'if'. If the condition is true, then all nested elements will be created, otherwise not. 

===== Command

A condition block has the following structure: 

[source]
----
$if(condition_name[, condition_modifier])
// child steps
$fi
----

A condition block must end with a '$fi' command. If the condition is not correctly ended (with '$fi'), then the template is considered ill-formed. 

===== Condition modifier

A condition block can have an optional condition modifier. The following pre-defined values can be used: 

[options="header]
|=======================
|Value|in template file|Effect
|NONE||Does not affect the condition.
|NOT|not|Negate the result of the condition. 
|=======================

The default value of the condition modifier is 'NONE'. 

NOTE: New line after the close command '$fi' is discarded.
